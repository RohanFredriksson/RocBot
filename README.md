#### Reasoning
Ever since music bots such as Rhythm and Groovy were taken down, my Discord server has lacked a nice way to listen to music with my friends. As a learning experience I decided to make my own music bot to fill this gap. I had worked with discordjsv11 prior to this project, but never had constructed anything useful so I saw this as a great opportunity to build something for an actual client. My friends provided great feedback for features that they wanted implemented and I would introduce these features. Through this experience I have become comfortable working with the discord.js v13 and audio streams, and have provided a product an excellent product to real users. As a bonus I can now can enjoy music with my friends once again.
